### An approach for detecting Malware using Machine Learning

In recent years, the malware industry has become a well-organized market involving large amounts of money. Well-funded, multi-player syndicates invest heavily in technologies and capabilities built to evade traditional protection, requiring anti-malware vendors to develop counter mechanisms for finding and deactivating them. In the meantime, they inflict real financial loss and breakdown critical infrastructure of the affected business systems.

The major challenges that anti-malware faces today is the vast amounts of data and files which need to be evaluated for potential malicious intent, but in recent events it has been seen that the viruses are constantly modified and/or obfuscated using various tactics, such that they look like many different files.

To address this issue, we have used the deep feature extraction properties of the neural network to analyze a file and classify whether it is a malware or not.
